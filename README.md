What is a database?

A database (DB) is a collection of data that lives for a long time. Many systems fit this definition, for example, a paper-based file system, a notebook, or even a string with knobs for counting.

A Database Management System (DBMS) is a system (software) that provides an interface to database for information storage and retrieval. We are more interested in software systems rather than manual systems because they can do the job more efficiently. The common features of a DBMS includescapacity for large amount of data

an easy to use interface language (SQL-structured query language)
efficient retrieval mechanisms
multi-user support
security management
concurrency and transaction control
persistent storage with backup and recovery for reliability
The users of a database assume difference roles such as

end user - application programmers that use the DB as a storage subsystem
designer - application programmers and/or business analysts who design the layout of the DB
administrator - operators who maintain the heath and efficiency of the DB
implementor - programmers who maintain and develop the DBMS
